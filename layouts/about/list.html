        <p>Protocol Labs Network (PLN) Launchpad is a six-week onboarding program to train, onboard, and match engineers
          and startup operators at scale with opportunities across the PL Network.

            Protocol Labs Network</li>
        </ul>

        Launchpad cohorts will onboard a wide funnel of primed talent into PL Network teams - and also grow network
        engineering culture, strong community bonds, and solid cross-functional knowledge of various parts of the PL
        Network tools and protocols.

    <h2> &nbsp Expectations</h2>
    <p>&nbsp This curriculum is designed for those who already have a basic set of technical skills. Launchpad Cadets
      should at a minimum already know:
    <ul>
      <li>How to use Github for source control, including making PRs & suggestions</li>
      <li>How to navigate and troubleshoot an operating system and install dependencies</li>
      <li>Experience with the basic software engineering design lifecycle</li>
      <li>Experience implementing and testing software projects</li>
      <li>The ability to read and write in programming languages (<i>software engineer participants only</i>)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> &nbsp Launchpad Principles</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Feedback is a gift.</b> Please give your feedback on the program and how we can make it better! If someone
        gives you feedback, it's because theyâ€™re trying to help you improve â€” but understand there are often many ways
        to do something, so give feedback with curiosity and an open mind.</li>
      <li><b>Improve as we go.</b> Related to the above, when you spot areas of improvement for the program, we want to
        capture them along the journey rather than hoping to remember them at the end. A retro will happen at the end,
        but please also post in Filecoin Slack as you see things. Including an emoji like ðŸ¤” can make it easier to
        harvest these thoughts for the retro.</li>
      <li><b>Be respectful.</b> This whole program falls under the <a
          href="https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">IPFS Code of Conduct</a>. Always be
        kind and welcoming.</li>
      <li><b>Collaboration.</b> Be proactively helpful to everyone you can. Answer questions, offer ideas, share your
        work and learnings - try to give back to the community and others who are helping you! Understand that many
        great ideas can blossom in parallel - avoid being competitive, secretive, or ego-ful about your work or ideas.
      </li>
      <li><b>Async first.</b> We bias toward async comms to support many time zones and schedules. Try to use slack
        threads, record meetings, and document your questions/learnings so others can benefit./li>
      <li><b>Transparency.</b> To promote a good OSS environment, we try to make our work open to all - even before
        weâ€™re ready. Please try to use group channels to post your questions instead of DMs (where others canâ€™t learn
        from you), and share your answers in public forums wherever possible (ex discourse, Filecoin slack, etc).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
